## Questions

#### How do I approach designing software?
When im designing a software it usually depends on the software im planning on making. Although
the majority of my designs tend to be simple instead of complex, they get the job done without
making the application feel cluttered. Having too many features and options can feel overwhelming
and make the application hardeer to work with.

#### How do I approach developing programs?
When I start a project I like to plan before hand. I first like reading through the documentation of any tool that
I plan on using and it helps me figure out what I will do. After studying I tend like to structure
the project so that I dont lose track on what I am supposed to be doing. When I start programming
I like to double check and constantly test my code so that it runs properly after copmpiling.
#### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I would like to become either a front-end of back-end engineer I believe that with the experience
in these courses I will be able to get accustomed to different programing languages and techniques used in the field.
I also want to get a broader view on what is available in the field, if i end up changing my mind
from being a front-end or back-end engineer due to the courses in the end itll be a benefit to me.
